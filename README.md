# synaptic-normalization
Computational model of synaptic competition for synaptic building blocks leading to multiplicative normalization and heterosynaptic plasticity.

This repository contains the Python code that was used for the simulations of the accompanying paper "Competition for a limited supply of synaptic building blocks predicts multiplicative synaptic normalization and heterosynaptic plasticity" by Jochen Triesch and Anne-Sophie Hafner.
